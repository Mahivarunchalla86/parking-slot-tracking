# parking-slot-tracking
"Develop a computer vision model to detect &amp; track parking slot occupancy in real-time using video feeds/images from overhead cameras. Key features: parking slot detection, occupancy tracking, real-time processing &amp; integration with digital displays/mobileÂ apps."
Project Overview:
The project aims to develop a computer vision-based model to detect and track parking slot occupancy in real-time using video feeds or images from overhead cameras. This will improve parking efficiency, reduce congestion, and enhance the overall user experience.

Objective:

- Detect individual parking slots using image processing and computer vision techniques.
- Determine the occupancy status of each parking slot (occupied or vacant) in real-time.
- Provide real-time information on parking availability through digital displays and mobile applications.

Methodology:

- Utilize image processing techniques such as edge detection, thresholding, and feature extraction to detect parking slots.
- Train machine learning models to classify parking slots as occupied or vacant based on visual features.
- Leverage object detection algorithms to detect vehicles and determine occupancy status.
- Implement real-time processing capabilities using frameworks such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

Expected Output:

- A computer vision model that can accurately detect and track parking slot occupancy in real-time.
- Real-time information on parking availability through digital displays and mobile applications.
- Data analytics on parking demand and usage patterns.

Applications:

- Smart parking systems
- Urban planning and development
- Autonomous vehicle development
- Parking management systems for commercial and residential areas.
